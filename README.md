# Composite Design Pattern Example: Organizational Hierarchy

This is a C# example illustrating the Composite design pattern. The Composite pattern allows clients to treat individual objects (leaves) and compositions of objects (composites) uniformly. In this scenario, the pattern is applied to an organizational hierarchy where employees (individuals) and departments (compositions) are represented.

## Pattern Components

### 1. Component: `IComponent`

**Purpose:** Common interface for both employees and departments.

**Explanation:** Defines the common operations like `Display()` for both individual employees and composite departments.

### 2. Leaf: `Employee`

**Purpose:** Represents an individual employee.

**Explanation:** Implements the `IComponent` interface and provides the `Display()` method for an individual employee.

### 3. Composite: `Department`

**Purpose:** Represents a department, a composition of employees.

**Explanation:** Implements the `IComponent` interface, managing a list of child components (employees). Provides the `AddEmployee()` method for adding employees to the department and the `Display()` method for displaying department details along with employee details.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile and run the C# program.
3. Observe how the Composite pattern is used to represent an organizational hierarchy with employees and departments.

## Purpose

The Composite pattern promotes the uniform treatment of individual objects and compositions of objects. In this example, it allows clients to interact with both individual employees and composite departments through a common interface (`IComponent`). The hierarchical structure allows for easy organization and manipulation of the organizational hierarchy.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own use cases to better understand how the Composite pattern can be applied in software development.
